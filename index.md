# ABOUT ME

Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) Department at University of Toronto. I work with [Prof. Merve Bodur](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/). My research interests include stochastic and programming methodologies, healthcare, and power system. I received my B.S. in Math and B.A. in Economics from Wuhan University in 2015, and M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University in 2017.
