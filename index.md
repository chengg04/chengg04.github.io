# About Me

Starting Fall 2021, I will become an Assistant Professor in the School of Mathematical & Statistical Sciences at Clemson University (Research area: Operations Research).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering at University of Toronto, advised by [<u>Merve Bodur</u>](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/). I received M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University in 2017, and my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2015. You can find my CV [<u>here</u>](/docs/cv_ChengGuo.pdf).
