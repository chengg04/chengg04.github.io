# About Me

I am on the 2020-2021 academic job market.

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at University of Toronto advised by [<u>Merve Bodur</u>](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/). The goal of my research is to develop novel optimization models and efficient solution algorithms that address challenging economic and engineering problems. I develop application-specific models and new methods, employing a combination of copositive, stochastic, and mixed-integer nonlinear optimization techniques and decomposition algorithms, including prior works in energy markets, power systems, and healthcare.
<!-- My research interests include stochastic and integer programming methodologies, healthcare, and power system. -->

For future research, I will further explore problems in the intersection of engineering and economics. In the short term, I will continue to study the market design and algorithms for nonconvex power systems and energy markets. In the long run, I am interested in leveraging computational tools including optimization and machine learning to bring insights to economic problems, such as energy markets, power system planning, pricing, and mechanism design for social good. I am also interested in developing algorithms to improve the solvability of those problems and other challenging optimization problems, with an emphasize on nonconvex and stochastic optimization problems. I would like my research to connect theory and practice, and to help practitioners to make more accurate predictions and better decisions.

I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2015, and M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University in 2017. You can find my CV [<u>here</u>](/docs/cv.pdf).
