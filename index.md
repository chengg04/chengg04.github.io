# About Me

I am on the academic job market for the year 2020-2021.

Iâ€™m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at University of Toronto. I work with [Prof. Merve Bodur](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/). The goal of my research is to develop novel optimization models and efficient solution algorithms that address challenging economic and engineering problems. I develop application-specific models and new methods, employing a combination of copositive, stochastic, and mixed-integer nonlinear optimization techniques and decomposition algorithms, including prior works in energy markets, power systems, and healthcare.
<!-- My research interests include stochastic and integer programming methodologies, healthcare, and power system. -->

I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2015, and M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University in 2017. You can find my CV [[here](/docs/cv.pdf)].
